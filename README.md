This is an *unofficial* LaTeX Beamer theme modelled after the Edinburgh University website.
Colour values were taken from the [logo guide][logo] as [PMS][pms] and translated into RGB.

To use it just place the `.sty` files where latex can find them and include
`\usetheme{Edinburgh}` in your preamble.

You can use the colour theme separately in combination with other themes
via `\usecolortheme{edinburgh}`.

These colour aliases are available for use with `\textcolor{}` etc:

If you know how to improve things, don't hesitate and fork away!
